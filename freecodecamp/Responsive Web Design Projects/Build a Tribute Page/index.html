				<h2>Les Paul father</h2>
				<p>Lester Paulus was an excellent guitar technician and engineer, as well as a very enthusiastic musician. He started playing the guitar from his very childhood - in the 20-30s. of the last century, country and folk enjoyed great popularity among guitarists, and guitar jazz was gaining popularity. Being passionate about the guitar and these styles, Les Paul in his youth began to study his favorite instrument from the technical side.</p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>It was the year 1940 and Lester went on a bold experiment: he sawed his two-piece Epiphone guitar into two parts, and inserted a pine beam between the resulting parts, on which the pickups were mounted. This prototype is called "Clunker". Trying to bring his idea to the masses, a young engineer visits Gibson, offering them to buy the idea of a similar guitar structure. At that time, the idea did not seem promising to the company - Les Paul leaves with nothing.</p>
				<h2>First Les Paul</h2>
				<p>In the early 50s, the idea of producing a full-body guitar was captured by Fender. Gibson could not miss such a moment. I needed a man with engineering skills and ambitions. Les Paul - it was he who was called by the company to participate in the development of a completely new guitar. Design took about a year. In 1952, the first prototypes were introduced and the first Gibson Les Paul guitar series was launched on the market for $ 210 a piece.</p>
