				<h2>Les Paul father</h2>
				<p>Lester Paulus was an excellent guitar technician and engineer, as well as enthusiastic musician. He started playing the guitar from his childhood - in the 20-30s. Country and folk enjoyed wide popularity among guitarists, and guitar jazz gained popularity. Being passionate about the guitar and these styles, Les Paul in his youth began study his favorite instrument from the technical side.</p>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>It was 1940 when Lester made an experiment: he sawed his guitar “Epiphone” into two parts. And after that inserted a pine bar between the parts, then mounted sound pickups there. The prototype called "Clunker". Trying bring his idea to masses, young engineer visited Gibson company and offered them buy his idea of a similar guitar structure. At that time, the idea did't seem promising to the company - Les Paul leaves with nothing.</p>
				<h2>First Les Paul</h2>
				<p>In the early 50s, the idea of producing a full-body guitar was captured by Fender company. Gibson could not miss such a moment. Copmpany needed a man with engineering skills and ambitions. Les Paul was invited for participation in development of absolutely new guitar. Design took about a year. In 1952 first prototypes were introduced and the first Gibson Les Paul guitar series was launched on the market for $ 210 a piece.</p>
